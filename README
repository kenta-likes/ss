To compile the system, enter the src/ directory and run 'make all'.  The client is configured
to connect to a server running on the localhost; if you wish to change the server address find
the variable HOSTNAME (the first static variable in the Client class) and change its value
to the address of the server.

To run the server, from the src/ directory run "java server.Server".

To run the client, from the src/ directory run "java client.Client".
